## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
Purpose of this project is to expand on my existing knowledge base by diving into more modern development practices which includes..
- Developing a backend application (MVC)
- Developing a live service (REST)
- Deploying a live service (CICD)
- Databases (Relational)
- Languages and Frameworks (Node.js, Expressv4, ...)

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Prerequisites and Installing
Fetch all necessary project dependencies
```
npm install
```

Then start the app

```

Once launched successfully, you'll be met with a Hello World splash screen.


## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>
There is a RESTful API endpoint that can perform basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations against the database.
```
/api/users/
/api/users/<user_id>
```

As more functionality is included this will be updated to reflect additional usage!
