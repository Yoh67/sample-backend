## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Purpose of this project is to expand on my existing knowledge base by diving into more modern development practices which includes..
- Developing a backend application (MVC)
- Developing a live service (REST)
- Deploying a live service (CICD)
- Databases (Relational)
- Languages and Frameworks (Node.js, Expressv4, ...)

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Prerequisites and Installing
Fetch all necessary project dependencies
```
npm install
```

Then start the app

```
npm start
```

Once launched successfully, you'll be met with a Hello World message at http://localhost:3000/


## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Using the RESTful API endpoints below, it is possible to execute basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations against the PostgreSQL database.

| REST Function | Endpoint       | Description             |
| ------------- | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| GET           | /api/users/    | Get All Users           |
| GET           | /api/users/:id | Get a Single User       |
| POST          | /api/users/    | Create a Single User    |
| PUT           | /api/users/:id | Update an Existing User |
| DELETE        | /api/users/:id | Delete an Existing User |

Updated for v1.0 of Sample-Backend.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
This app will be deployed on every successful commit via Heroku, this pipeline is not a "true" CICD workflow in the sense that there are not integration tests in the heroku branch environments to run against at this stage.

## ‚õèÔ∏è Built Using <a name = "built_using"></a>

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Server Framework

"Tip of the hat" to all folks who's repositories are probably used on a consistent basis to create the foundation of most backend applications like this, these folks don't get enough thanks!
